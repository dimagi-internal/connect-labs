"""Auditing more than the weight photo.

KMC visits carry three photos worth auditing: the weight photo the scale classifier reads,
plus an equipment photo and a KMC-wrap photo that no classifier exists for. Collecting all
three in ONE audit is the point -- a reviewer should not need a second workflow to look at
the wrap photos -- and that is what makes the two risks here worth pinning:

* A single ``ai_agent_id`` is applied to EVERY image in a session. Sent down that path, the
  scale classifier would be handed equipment and wrap photos and would report each one as a
  scale mismatch: false flags on photos it was never meant to see, at full gateway cost.
* Adding photos nothing can score must not change what the weight photos scored. The photo
  types are therefore kept separable end to end rather than blended into one total.

The weight-only case is deliberately left on the exact call this workflow has always made,
because that is what the nightly schedule runs unattended.
