"""Request/task-scoped audit context propagation.

A contextvar carries "who is acting and from where" from the edge (middleware,
MCP auth, Celery task entry) down to the data-access choke points, which call
``service.record()`` without needing a request object.

Two modes:

- **Buffered** (web requests): ``AuditTrailMiddleware`` opens a context with a
  buffer; ``record()`` appends pending events; the middleware flushes them
  after the response — outside the view's ATOMIC_REQUESTS transaction — so
  audit rows survive request rollbacks and carry the final status code.
- **Immediate** (Celery, MCP, scripts): ``audit_context()`` sets attribution
  with no buffer; ``record()`` writes each event straight to the DB + log
  stream.

Contextvars propagate across Django's sync/async boundaries (asgiref) but NOT
into ThreadPoolExecutor workers — events recorded from hand-rolled thread
pools fall back to unattributed immediate writes, which is acceptable
best-effort behavior.
