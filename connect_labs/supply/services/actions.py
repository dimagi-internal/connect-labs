"""What the centre decided to do, and the movement it actually creates.

A reallocation is not a status change. It creates a real
:class:`~..models.Shipment` from the surplus node with planned milestones and
stored route geometry, and every downstream figure — the destination's weeks of
cover, the corridor's pipeline gap, the flow map — recomputes from that
shipment rather than being adjusted to match the decision.

That distinction is the whole argument for recording actions here at all. A
decision that only moves a number is indistinguishable from someone editing the
number. A decision that puts a consignment on the map is the same kind of fact
as the consignments already on it, and the exception resolves because the
situation changed.
