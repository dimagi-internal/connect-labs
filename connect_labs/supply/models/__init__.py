"""Supply domain models, split by lifecycle stage.

Procurement runs up to the award decision; execution carries that decision out;
demand is the denominator both of those lack — the caseload a district is
expected to have and what a treated child's measurements did. They are separate
modules because they change for different reasons and are worked on at
different times — but they remain one Django app, so every model is re-exported
here and ``from connect_labs.supply.models import X`` keeps working regardless
of which third X lives in.
