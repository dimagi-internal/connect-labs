"""Persona switching for local walkthrough capture. DEBUG only.

A DDD render drives four narratives through four different personas, and every
one of them has to reach the app as a logged-in session. Supply authenticates
with an ordinary Django login form, so the alternative is teaching the capture
harness to fill and submit a form before each run — which makes the login page
part of every recording and puts the demo password in four recipe files.

This mirrors ``connect_labs/labs/views_test_auth.py`` exactly, including its
guard: outside ``DEBUG`` it is a hard 403 before anything else happens. Supply
is deployed on a public host with open registration, so that guard is the whole
reason this is acceptable — ``config/settings/labs_aws.py`` runs with
``DEBUG=False``, and `tests/test_dev_auth.py` asserts the refusal rather than
trusting the setting.

It logs in ONLY personas the demo seed created, by exact email, and never
creates a user. There is no path here to an account the seed did not already
make.
